# README

This series of labs recorded how I used Jetson Nano 4G development kit to do some basic AI learning including using Jetson Nano + the pre-trained mdoels to do the image classification and object detection, and also to develop my own codes to do the re-training, classification and object detection.

Here is an index of the labs.

## [Lab 1: Set up the Hello AI World environment](Lab1-Set_up_Environment.md)
## [Lab 2: Classiy images with imageNet](Lab2-Classify_Images_with_ImageNet..md)
## [Lab 3: Develop yoru own image recognition program](Lab3-Develop_Your_Own_Image_Recognition_program.md)
## [Lab 4: Re-train classfication/recognition (ResNet-18)](Lab4-Re-Train_classification(ResNet-18).md)
## [Lab 5: Locate objects with DetectNet](Lab5-Locate_Objects_with_DetectNet.md)
## [Lab 6: Develop your own Object detection program](Lab6-Develop_Your_Own_Object_Detection_program.md)
